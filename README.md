<h1>This is an OpenGL application that allows you to view the mandelbrot set</h1>

- This code uses a compute shader to simultaneously compute the mandelbrot set for each pixel on the screen.
- User can use WASD and scroll to move around and zoom into the set, up until the point that floats do not contain enough precision.
